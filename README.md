## Task 1 (bivariate_normal_distribution.ipynb)
Fairly simple to navigate. Execute all the cells and then use ipywidget slider in the thrid cell to change values of mean, variance, covariance using slider.


Graph generated is not showing on github. I guess due to presence of sliders please use google colab to view this task
